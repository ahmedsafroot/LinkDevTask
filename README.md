4. copy default.settings.php and rename it to be **settings.php** then change your database settings
5. create virtual host to your project
6. open your host -> if you create new database just complete steps to install project if not user this username (ahmedrefaat) and password(12345678) to login as admin
7. run **yourhost/update.php** to install custom tables . you can ignore this step if you use database in code files
8. install custom module events management from extend tab . . you can ignore this step if you use database in code files
9. inside configuration page you will find event management link to config event module [admin/config/site-settings]
10. admin list all events via **[admin/listing-events]** . you will all crud here
11. front end user can list and view details event via **[listing-events]**
12. for view custom block for latest 5 events created go to structure then block layout and put **event block** in any place you want.

**Note:** i have been created custom table for events as task doesn't clear using custom table or else, there another solution as we can create content type for events then create view for page listing and for block
